# Mob Time

Windows desktop mobbing/meeting timer.

* Remains in front of (most) other windows for always-there usage.
* Choose to either count up or count down.
* Select how many minutes to target/count for.
* UI clearly shows when the timer runs over and by how much.
* Remembers the target/count duration between sessions.
* Runs in a compact window to reduce screen wastage.
* Fades out when you switch your focus elsewhere.
* Automatically regains focus as required.
